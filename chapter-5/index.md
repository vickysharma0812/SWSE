# Internal structure of earth

This lecture discusses about the materials which are available inside and on the earth such as minerals, rocks, and soils. These materials are also important in earth system processes. We will discuss the overall structure of the earth, including the crust, mantle, and core. Additionally, we will explore the different types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic) and their formation processes. Understanding these materials and processes is crucial for comprehending various geological phenomena and the dynamic nature of our planet.
