# Minerals

In geology, minerals are the building blocks of rocks and are essential for understanding the Earth's composition and the processes that shape its surface. Each mineral has a unique set of physical properties, such as hardness, color, luster, and cleavage, which help in its identification and classification.

The study of minerals, known as mineralogy, involves examining their properties, structures, and the conditions under which they form. This knowledge is crucial for various applications, including resource extraction, environmental science, and understanding geological history.

Minerals are also important for human use, providing essential materials for construction, manufacturing, technology, and even health. For example, minerals like gypsum are used in plaster, while others like lithium are critical for batteries.

Understanding minerals and their properties allows geologists to interpret the history and dynamics of the Earth's interior and surface, contributing to our broader knowledge of planetary science.

## Compounds and Mixture

Compounds are formed when one or more types of anion are chemically combined with one or more cations in a certain ratio. For example, hydrogen ions (H$^{+}$) and oxygen ions (O$^{-2}$) are combined 2:1, resulting in compounds of H2O (water). 

:::{note}
In a compound, the sum of the positive and negative charge must be zero. 
:::

The formulas for compounding are first placed by the cations and second by the anions. Subscripts show the number of ions or ions, and for convenience the charge of the ions is usually left out. 

A molecule is the smallest unit that retains all the properties of a compound. Further, the properties of molecules are often very different from the properties of the elements they contain. For example, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) are both highly toxic, but together they form sodium chloride (NaCl, or table salt), which is essential for human health.

Sometimes, two types of ions form bonds so strong that they behave like a single ion, known as a complex ion. Complex ions function like single ions, forming compounds by bonding with oppositely charged ions.

For example, carbon and oxygen can combine to form the complex carbonate anion $\text{CO}_{3}^{-2}$. The carbonate anion then bonds with cations such as $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Ca}^{+2}$ to form compounds such as $\text{Na}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}$ and $\text{Ca}\text{CO}_{3}$.

Compounds are distinct from mixtures and play an essential role in Earth processes. To form a compound, a chemical reaction must take place, causing changes or exchanges at the atomic level. When two or more liquids or several gases mix thoroughly without a chemical reaction, they form a mixture. If the mixture is uniform and its components are not easily distinguishable, it’s called a homogeneous mixture or solution.

Since mixtures and solutions are not compounds, their components retain their original identities without any atomic-level changes. For instance, mixing lemon juice with water creates a well-blended liquid, but because there’s no reaction, it is not a compound. Dissolving sugar in water creates a homogeneous mixture, or solution, in which both sugar and water molecules remain unchanged. The gels and colloids mentioned earlier are also mixtures, not compounds.

Mixtures and solutions aren’t limited to liquids or gases. For instance, a bowl of chocolate chips and peanuts is a mixture of two solid phases. If you blended the chocolate and peanuts into a smooth, uniform mix, it would be considered a solution, but it would still be a mixture, not a compound, since the chocolate and peanuts remain distinct at the molecular level.

Compounds differ from mixtures and solutions because mixtures and solutions can be separated by physical or mechanical methods, while the components of compounds can only be separated chemically. For example, sugar can be separated from water by evaporation. Even a lemon juice and water mixture can be separated if left to sit, as the lemon juice will eventually settle at the bottom (which is why fruit juices often need to be stirred or shaken). A mixture of flour and fine iron powder can be separated using a magnet to attract the iron particles. Separation methods such as filtering, evaporation, settling, or magnetic attraction indicate that these combinations are mixtures or solutions, not compounds.

## Organic and Inorganic materials

Organic materials in geology refer to substances that originate from living organisms. These materials include plant debris, animal remains, and other biological matter that can accumulate and transform into fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas over geological time scales. Organic materials are rich in carbon and are essential for understanding the carbon cycle and the history of life on Earth.

From a chemistry perspective, organic materials are primarily composed of carbon atoms bonded with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements. These materials are typically associated with living organisms and include compounds such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Organic chemistry focuses on the study of these carbon-containing compounds and their reactions. Today, the term “organic” commonly refers to compounds made of carbon atoms connected to each other by strong covalent bonds.

Inorganic materials, on the other hand, are composed of minerals and other non-living substances. These materials form through various geological processes such as crystallization from molten rock, precipitation from water, or changes in temperature and pressure. Inorganic materials make up the bulk of the Earth's crust and include common minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mica, as well as rocks such as granite, basalt, and limestone. In this way, inorganic materials encompass a broad range of substances that do not primarily consist of carbon-hydrogen bonds. These include metals, salts, minerals, and other compounds that are often derived from non-living sources. Inorganic chemistry deals with the properties and behaviors of these materials, including their structures, bonding, and reactions.

Understanding the distinction between organic and inorganic materials is crucial in geology, as it helps in the study of Earth's composition, the processes that shape its surface, and the history of life and environmental conditions over time.

A common feature of organic compounds is their tendency to form long, chain-like structures called polymers. In polymerization, small molecules called monomers link together to create long chains or three-dimensional networks. Polymerization plays a key role in both organic and inorganic molecules, as seen in the crystal structures of minerals.

## Definition of minerals

A mineral is formally defined as an element or a chemical compound that must meet the following criteria:

- Naturally formed: It must occur naturally, excluding human-made substances like synthetic diamonds.
- Solid: It is typically a solid, excluding most fluids and gases.
- Characteristic chemical formula: It must have a specific chemical formula.
- Crystalline structure: It usually has a crystalline structure, though some geologists revised the definition in the mid-1990s to include noncrystalline solids and certain liquids, such as mercury.

:::{note}
Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure. 
:::

Minerals can be either elements or compounds. The example of element mineral is diamond which is made entirely of carbon. The example of compound mineral is PbS (lead sulfide) is called _galena_ which is found in nature.

Minerals form through various geological processes, including crystallization from molten rock (magma or lava), precipitation from water, and changes in temperature and pressure within the Earth's crust. Common examples of minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, calcite, and olivine. These minerals combine in different ways to form the diverse range of rocks found on Earth.

## Chemical bondings in minerals

The atoms that make up a mineral are held together by chemical bonds, which result from attractive forces between atoms, the sharing of electrons, or both. The type of bonding influences many of the mineral’s physical properties. For example, it helps explain why diamonds and graphite, both made of pure carbon (C), have the same chemical formula but exhibit very different physical characteristics.

There are four main types of chemical bonds in minerals: covalent, ionic, van der Waals, and metallic.

### Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons to achieve a full outer electron shell. This type of bonding is very strong and results in minerals with high hardness and melting points. For example, in a diamond, each carbon atom shares electrons with four other carbon atoms, creating a very strong and hard structure.

### Ionic Bonds

Ionic bonds occur when one atom donates an electron to another atom, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions that attract each other. This type of bonding is common in minerals like halite (NaCl), where sodium (Na) donates an electron to chlorine (Cl), forming a stable ionic bond. Ionic bonds typically result in minerals that are brittle and have high melting points.

### Van der Waals Bonds

Van der Waals bonds are weak attractions between molecules or atoms due to temporary dipoles that occur when electrons are unevenly distributed. These bonds are much weaker than covalent or ionic bonds and result in minerals with low hardness and melting points. An example of a mineral with van der Waals bonds is graphite, where layers of carbon atoms are held together by these weak forces, allowing the layers to slide over each other easily.

### Metallic Bonds

Metallic bonds occur when electrons are shared and move freely among a lattice of metal atoms. This type of bonding gives metals their characteristic properties, such as electrical conductivity, malleability, and ductility. In minerals with metallic bonds, such as native copper (Cu), the electrons can move freely, allowing the mineral to conduct electricity and be shaped without breaking.

## Crystalline structure of minerals

Crystalline structures in minerals refer to the orderly and repeating arrangement of atoms within the mineral. This regular pattern extends in all three spatial dimensions, forming a crystal lattice that defines the mineral's shape and physical properties. 

In geology, the crystalline structure of a mineral is crucial for its identification and classification. The arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice determines the mineral's symmetry, cleavage, and overall morphology. For example, the cubic structure of [halite](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crystal-structure-of-halite-4d75081d5a8a4733808571c846308807) (NaCl) results in its characteristic cubic crystals, while the hexagonal structure of [quartz](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/quartz-crystal-cluster-80a2f60700ac4593955392cac20b9415a) (SiO₂) leads to its six-sided prisms.

Crystalline structures are formed through various geological processes, such as the cooling and solidification of molten rock (magma or lava), precipitation from mineral-rich solutions, and metamorphic transformations under high pressure and temperature. The conditions under which a mineral forms can influence the size and perfection of its crystals. 

:::{note}
Slow cooling typically allows for the growth of larger, well-formed crystals, while rapid cooling can result in smaller, less defined crystals.
:::

The study of crystalline structures, known as crystallography, involves analyzing the geometric arrangement of atoms and the symmetry of the crystal lattice. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction are used to determine the atomic structure of minerals, providing insights into their properties and behavior.

Understanding the crystalline structure of minerals is essential for geologists, as it helps in interpreting the formation conditions and history of rocks, as well as in exploring their potential uses in various applications, from construction materials to technological components.
