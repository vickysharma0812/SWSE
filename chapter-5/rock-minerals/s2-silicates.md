# Silicates

Minerals that include the elements silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) in their chemical composition are called silicates; these are the most abundant of the rock-forming minerals. 

## Silicate structure

All silicate minerals is the pyramid-shaped silicon–oxygen (Si-O) tetrahedron composed of relatively large oxygen ions (-2 charge) at the corners, with the small silicon ion (+4 charge) in the center. In in way, most silicates, silicon atom occupies the center of an idealized tetrahedron whose corners are four oxygen atoms, connected to it by single covalent bonds.

> An isolated silicon tetrahedron has a net -4 charge. This has profound consequences for the structure of silicate minerals. 

Silicon tetrahdron has mesodesmic bonds. It means that each oxygen ion has one of its two valence charges satisfied by bonding with silicon ion (+4) at the center of the tetrahedron. The remaining -1 charge is available to bond with a silicon ion (+4) in the center of another tetrahedron. Therefore, silicon tetrahedron may polymerize. The degree to which the oxygen anions are shared between adjacent tetrahedron determines the structure of silicate minerals as shown in Table below.

```{note}
The structure produced by the tetrahedra in their various configurations have a net negative charge. Cations, if available, can balance the excess negative charge. In this way, cations act as glue that holds the silicate tetrahedron structures together.

- These minerals are commonly found in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.
- Sheet silicates can exhibit a range of colors and are often used in industrial applications such as ceramics and cosmetics.

```{note}
In general, a high degree of polymerization is possible only if silicon is relatively abundant. Therefore, framework silicates such as quartz and K-feldspar are found in Si rich rocks. Whereas, orthosilicates such as olivine found in rocks which has lesser amount of Si and sufficient amount of Fe and Mg.

## Mafic versus felsic

Mafic and felsic are terms used to describe the composition of igneous rocks based on their silica content and the types of minerals they contain.

### Mafic silicates

Mafic silicates are rich in magnesium and iron (hence the term "mafic" from magnesium and ferric). They have a lower silica content, typically between 45-55%. These rocks are generally darker in color and denser than felsic rocks. Common mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite.

Examples of mafic rocks:
- Basalt
- Gabbro

Highlights:
- Mafic rocks are typically found in oceanic crust.
- They are associated with volcanic activity at mid-ocean ridges and hotspots.
- Mafic rocks have higher melting points compared to felsic rocks.

### Felsic silicates

Felsic silicates are rich in silica and aluminum. They have a higher silica content, typically between 65-75%. These rocks are generally lighter in color and less dense than mafic rocks. Common felsic minerals include quartz, feldspar, and muscovite.

Examples of felsic rocks:
- Granite
- Rhyolite

Highlights:
- Felsic rocks are typically found in continental crust.
- They are associated with volcanic activity at convergent plate boundaries.
- Felsic rocks have lower melting points compared to mafic rocks.

### Intermediate silicates

Intermediate silicates have a silica content between that of mafic and felsic rocks, typically between 55-65%. They contain a mix of mafic and felsic minerals.

Examples of intermediate rocks:
- Andesite
- Diorite

Highlights:
- Intermediate rocks are commonly found in volcanic arcs associated with subduction zones.
- They exhibit a range of colors from light to dark.

Understanding the differences between mafic and felsic rocks is crucial for geologists as it helps in interpreting the geological history and tectonic settings of an area.
