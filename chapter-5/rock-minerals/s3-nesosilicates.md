# Nesosilicates (Isolated silicates)

Isolated orthosilicate anions have the formula $\text{SiO}^{-4}$. 

A common mineral in this group is Olivine which is a magnesium iron silicate with the formula $\text{(Mg,Fe)}_{2}\text{SiO}_{4}$. 
- It is a common mineral in the Earth's subsurface but weathers quickly on the surface.
- Olivine is typically green in color and has a glassy luster. 
- It is a primary component of the Earth's mantle and is also found in some meteorites.
- In olivine, the â€“4 charge of each silica tetrahedron is balanced by two divalent (i.e., +2) iron or magnesium cations. 
- Olivine can be either $\text{Mg}_{2}\text{SiO}_{4}$ or $\text{Fe}_{2}\text{SiO}_{4}$, or some combination of the two $\text{(Mg,Fe)}_{2}\text{SiO}_{4}$. 
- The divalent cations of magnesium and iron are quite close in radius (0.73 versus 0.62 angstroms). Because of this size similarity, and because they are both divalent cations (both have a charge of +2), iron and magnesium can readily substitute for each other in olivine and in many other minerals. 
- $\text{Mg}_{2}\text{SiO}_{4}$ is called forsterite (see [Figure](#forsterite)). Forsterite's melting temperature is unusually high at atmospheric pressure, almost 1,900 degree Celcius.
- $\text{Fe}_{2}\text{SiO}_{4}$ is called fayalite (see [Figure](#fayalite)). Fayalite's melting temperature is much lower, about 1,200 degree Celcius. 

:::{note}
Because the tetrahedra are not polymerized, there are no consistent planes of internal atomic weakness, so they also have no cleavage. Garnet is another common mineral with this structure.
