# Rock forming minerals

Although there are over 4,000 known minerals, only a few dozen are commonly found in Earth’s materials on or near the surface. These minerals are significant for many environmental concerns and are essential for identifying most Earth materials, such as rocks, which are aggregates of one or more minerals.

The table below lists the most abundant chemical elements in the continental crust. Notably, oxygen and silicon dominate, accounting for over 70% of the crust by weight. These 12 elements—oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, titanium, hydrogen, manganese, and phosphorus—are known as the abundant elements and together make up 99.23% of the continental crust.

## Common rock forming minerals

### Silicates

The silicate minerals are the most abundant group of minerals in the earth's crust. 

Minerals that include the elements silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) in their chemical composition are called silicates; these are the most abundant of the rock-forming minerals. All silicate minerals is the pyramid-shaped silicon–oxygen tetrahedron composed of relatively large oxygen ions at the corners, with the small silicon ion in the center. In in way, most silicates, silicon atom occupies the center of an idealized tetrahedron whose corners are four oxygen atoms, connected to it by single covalent bonds.

- For example, quartz, form beautiful and appealing crystals. 
- Some silicates are used as precious or semiprecious gemstones.
- Some silicates such as quartz, beryl, and zircon, are mined or quarried for getting specific elements (Si, Be, and Zr, respectively). 
- Silicates also make agriculture possible. This is because many soils contain silicate minerals such as quartz and clays.

In mineralogy, silicate minerals are classified into seven major groups according to the structure of their silicate anion:

```{csv-table} Classification of silicate minerals
:header: "Major group", 	"Structure", 	"Chemical formula", 	"Example"
Nesosilicates, 	isolated silicon tetrahedra, 	[SiO4]4−, 	olivine garnet zircon
Sorosilicates, 	double tetrahedra, 	[Si2O7]6−, 	epidote melilite group
Cyclosilicates, 	rings, 	[SinO3n]2n−, 	beryl group tourmaline group
Inosilicates, 	single chain, 	[SinO3n]2n−, 	pyroxene group
Inosilicates, 	double chain, 	[Si4nO11n]6n−, 	amphibole group
Phyllosilicates, 	sheets, 	[Si2nO5n]2n−, 	micas and clays
Tectosilicates, 	3D framework, 	[AlxSiyO(2x+2y)]x−, 	quartz feldspars zeolites

### Quartz

Quartz, a form of silicon dioxide (SiO2), is one of the most abundant minerals in Earth's crust. It is harder than glass and fractures conchoidally. Pure quartz is colorless, but impurities can make it white, rose, purple, or smoky black (see [Figure](#quartz2)). Some colored varieties, like amethyst, are semiprecious gemstones. Large, clear quartz crystals are common and often sold as crystals. 

> Quartz is very resistant to weathering and is commonly found in river and beach sands.

### Feldspar

Feldspars are aluminosilicates that contain silicon (Si), oxygen (O), and aluminum (Al) combined with potassium (K), sodium (Na), or calcium (Ca) in a network of silicon–oxygen tetrahedra. These are the most abundant group of rock-forming minerals, constituting 60 percent of Earth’s crust. Feldspars are commercially important in the ceramics and glass industries. They are generally gray or pink and are fairly hard.

There are two major types of feldspar: 

1. Alkali feldspars: $\text{(Na, K)AlSi}_{3}\text{O}_{8}$, which represent several feldspar minerals rich in potassium (K-feldspar) or sodium

2. Plagioclase feldspars: $\text{(Na, Ca) Al(Si, Al)Si}_{2}\text{O}_{8}$, which range from sodium-rich to calcium-rich minerals. Elements in parentheses, like (Na, Ca), can substitute for each other.

> Feldspars may weather chemically to form clay minerals with important environmental implications.

### Mica

Mica refers to a group of rock-forming minerals made from sheets of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra. This group includes muscovite (colorless mica) with the formula KAl₂(AlSi₃)O₁₀(OH)₂, and biotite (ferromagnesian mica). Micas are known for their perfect basal cleavage, allowing them to split into thin sheets. Historically, muscovite was used as a window material and later in oven doors to see inside.

### Ferromagnesian Minerals

Ferromagnesian minerals are silicates that combine silicon and oxygen with iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). These minerals are typically dark in color (black, brown, or green). 

- **Biotite**: Black mica, K(Mg, Fe)₃AlSi₃O₁₀(OH)₂, formed from sheets of silicon–oxygen tetrahedra.
- **Olivine**: (Mg, Fe)₂SiO₄, formed from individual silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with magnesium and iron substituting for each other.
- **Pyroxene**: (Ca, Mg, Fe)₂Si₂O₆, a single-chain silicon–oxygen tetrahedra group of minerals.
- **Amphibole**: (Na, Ca)₂(Mg, Al, Fe)₅Si₈O₂₂(OH)₂, a double-chain silicon–oxygen tetrahedra group of minerals.

These minerals are important for identifying igneous rocks, which form from the solidification of magma.

Because they are not very resistant to weathering and erosional processes, ferromagnesian minerals tend to be altered or removed from their location relatively quickly. They weather readily and combine with oxygen during the chemical process known as oxidation. Oxides are mineral compounds that link oxygen with metallic elements, as, for example, hematite and limonite (hydrous iron oxide, common rust). Ferromagnesian minerals combine readily with other elements to form clays and soluble salts. Ferromagnesian minerals, when abundant, may produce weak rocks, and builders must be cautious when evaluating a construction site that contains rocks high in ferromagnesian minerals. Caution is especially important for highway, tunnel, and reser- voir planning.
