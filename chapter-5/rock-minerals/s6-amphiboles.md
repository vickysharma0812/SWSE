# Amphiboles

Amphiboles are a group of inosilicate minerals, forming prism or needle-like crystals, composed of double chain SiOâ‚„ tetrahedra, linked at the vertices and generally containing ions of iron and/or magnesium in their structures. They are commonly found in metamorphic and igneous rocks.

## Common Types of Amphiboles

1. **Hornblende**: A complex dark green to black amphibole mineral found in many igneous and metamorphic rocks.
2. **Tremolite**: A white to light green amphibole mineral that forms in metamorphosed dolomitic limestones.
3. **Actinolite**: A green amphibole mineral that is typically found in metamorphic rocks such as schist and gneiss.

## Properties

- **Crystal System**: Monoclinic or orthorhombic
- **Cleavage**: Two directions at 56 and 124 degrees
- **Hardness**: 5-6 on the Mohs scale
- **Luster**: Vitreous to dull

Amphiboles are important constituents of many metamorphic rocks and can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rocks formed.

Double chains form when every other tetrahedron in a single chain shares a third oxygen ion with an adjoining chain. Like single chains, the double chains still maintain a net negative charge and bond to cations that can form bridges between multiple double chains.

> Double chain silicates, called amphiboles, host a wider variety of cations, including Fe2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, and Na+, and have a wide variety of colors. The most common amphibole is hornblende, a black mineral found in igneous rocks like granite and andesite. Amphiboles tend to form prismatic crystals with two cleavage planes at 120 degrees to each other.
