# Pyroxenes

Inosilicates, or chain silicates, have interlocking chains of silicate tetrahedra with either $\text{SiO}_{3}$, 1:3 ratio, for single chains or $\text{Si}_{4}\text{O}_{11}$, 4:11 ratio, for double chains.  

Pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, which are generally dark-colored. > In a chain silicates two tetrahedrons share an oxygen atom, and two oxygen atoms of a tetrahedron are shared with other tetrahedron as shown in figure below. The chains have a net negative charge, and the chains bond to metal cations like $\text{Fe}^{2+}$, $\text{Mg}^{2+}$, and $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ to balance the negative charge. These metal cations commonly bond to multiple chains, forming bridges between the chains.

Because the bonds within the tetrahedra are strong, planes of atomic weakness do not cross the chains; instead, pyroxenes have two cleavage planes parallel to the chains and at nearly right angles to each other.

Pyroxenes are found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

> Pyroxenes are found in volcanic lavas as crystals in volcanic glass. They form early, before the lava erupts. The Earth's upper mantle mainly consists of olivine and pyroxene. Pyroxene and feldspar are key minerals in basalt, andesite, and gabbro rocks.

The pyroxene group includes both **orthorhombic** and **monoclinic** minerals. 

The orthopyroxenes consist essentially of a simple chemical series of $\text{(Mg,Fe)SiO}_{3}$ minerals, in contrast with the larger group of monoclinic pyroxenes which have a very wide range of chemical composition.

We can divide the pyroxenes into three major subgroups: 

- Magnesium-iron pyroxenes
- calciumâ€“sodium pyroxenes
- aegirine-augite

- magnesium-iron pyroxenes in which other cations occupy less than 10% of the M1 and M2 sites in the general formula:

$$
\text{(M2)(M1)(Si,Al)}_{2}\text{O}_{6}
$$

calcium-rich pyroxenes in which Ca occupies more than two-thirds of the M2 sites, and the sodium-rich pyroxenes in which the M2 site is largely occupied by Na and the M1 site by Al, Fe3+ or Cr as in jadeite, aegirine and kosmochlor, respectively.

## Structure of pyroxenes

The essential feature of the pyroxene structure is the presence of chains of corner-sharing (Si,Al) tetrahedra (see [figure](#single-chain); blue), which have the composition $\text{(Si,Al)O}_{3}$. The apical oxygens of the tetrahedra are shared on each side of a ribbon of M-O octahedra.
