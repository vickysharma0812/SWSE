# Matter

Matter is substance with finite mass. It occupies space. A matter can be found in various physical states. The three most common states of matter are: 

## State of matter

- Solid: Solids have a definite shape and volume. The particles in a solid are closely packed together and vibrate in place, which gives solids their rigid structure. The atoms in solid state have little mobility. Most of solid can resist a force, i.e., deforming a solid is a little difficult task.
- Liquid: Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. The particles in a liquid are less tightly packed than in a solid and can move past each other, allowing liquids to flow. 
- Gas: Gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume. The particles in a gas are far apart and move freely, allowing gases to expand and fill any container they are in.

Example of liquid state: lava and water.

## Change of state

We are all familiar with the three states of water (H2O); ice (solid), liquid water, and vapor (gas).

- Melting is a process in which a matter changes from its solid state to liquid state. The reverse process is called the freezing.
- Boiling is a process in which a matter changes from its liquid state to gaseous state. The reverse process is called the condensation.
- Sublimation is a process in which a matter changes from its solid state to gaseous state directly. For example in dry ice, wherein, CO2 changes from solid state to its gaseous state. 

## Phases

What is the difference between state and phase?

The concepts of phase is defined for a mixture. The mixture can contains two or more matter in same or different states. These state of matter will be called phase if the boundary of matter are well defined.

Example 1: For example consider a mixture of oil ans water. In this case, we have two matter which are in same state. We know that oil and water are immicible, therefore, they form an interface. In this way, in the mixture we have two phases; oil and water.

Example 2: Similary we can have a mixture of solids such as mixture of beans. Another example is a cookie with nuts in it.

Example 3: We can also have a mixture of same matter with different state. For example, consider a closed glass which contains liquid water, ice, and vapor. In this case we have interface between water and ice, water and vapor, and ice and vapor. This is an example of three phase system.

:::{note}
A mixture of gases cannot form multi phase system. This is because gas are miscible, therefore, they do not form a distinct boundary amongh them. Therefore, a mixture of gas is always single phase.

## Other less common states of matter

### Plasama

Plasama is ionized gas. Plasma is a common form of matter found in the Sun, stars, and materials in space. On Earth, we see plasma in natural events like lightning and the northern and southern lights (Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis). Plasma is also used in things we make, like neon signs, arc welders, and plasma TVs.

### Colloids

Colloids contains very fine particles which are dispersed in a continuous medium (usually liquid or gas). The size of particles in colloids is usually lesser than 1 $\mu m$. A colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). The fine particles are so small that they do not settle out but remain suspended in the surrounding medium

Whipped cream is an example of colloids in which continuous phase is liquid and dispered phase is air (or pockets of air).

### Gels

Gels differ from other colloids because their solid particles form an interconnected network. This network prevents the particles from settling and gives the gel its semisolid structure. In some advanced materials, the liquid in the gel is removed and replaced with vapor, leaving a very low-density solid structure known as an aerogel, or “frozen smoke.”

### Aerosols

Colloids made of microparticles or nanoparticles suspended in a gas (like air) are known as aerosols. A common example of a natural aerosol is fog. If you have asthma or know someone who does, you may know that medicines are often given as aerosols, where tiny liquid droplets of medicine are carried by a pressurized gas stream.
