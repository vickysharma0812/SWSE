# Atoms, Elements, Ions, and Isotopes

Geochemistry, the study of Earth’s chemistry, includes examining atoms and elements important to geological processes. Geochemistry also involves studying the natural distribution of chemical elements in minerals, rocks, soils, water, and the atmosphere, as well as how atoms move through the environment. Let’s begin with some definitions.

All matter—including rocks, minerals, water, and even ourselves—is made up of atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of a chemical element that can participate in a chemical reaction or bond with another atom. An element is a chemical substance made of identical atoms that cannot be separated into different substances by normal chemical methods.

## Conceptual model of an atom 

An atom consists of a central nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The nucleus contains protons, which have a positive charge, and neutrons, which are neutral. Electrons, which have a negative charge, orbit the nucleus in various energy levels or shells. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the atomic number of an element and determines its chemical properties. The arrangement of electrons in the outermost shell, or valence shell, influences how atoms interact and bond with each other.

In this model, the nucleus is depicted as a dense core containing protons and neutrons, while electrons are shown in orbitals around the nucleus. This simplified representation helps in understanding the basic structure and behavior of atoms in chemical reactions.

The structure of the atom was determined through a series of scientific discoveries and experiments over centuries, driven by the goal to understand the fundamental nature of matter. Here is an overview of key milestones in this development:

### Ancient Concepts (5th century BCE):
Early atomic theory originated with Greek philosophers like Democritus, who proposed that all matter was composed of tiny, indivisible particles called “atomos,” meaning “indivisible.” However, this was purely philosophical, with no experimental evidence.

### John Dalton’s Atomic Theory (1803):
John Dalton, an English chemist, developed the first scientific atomic theory. He proposed that atoms were the smallest units of matter, indivisible and indestructible, and that each element consisted of unique atoms differing by mass. Dalton’s theory also introduced the idea that atoms combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds, laying the groundwork for later discoveries.

### Discovery of the Electron (1897):
In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron through experiments with cathode rays. He observed that these rays were composed of negatively charged particles, which he called “corpuscles” (later known as electrons). Thomson proposed the “plum pudding model,” suggesting that atoms consisted of a positively charged sphere with embedded electrons, similar to raisins in a pudding. This was the first model to include subatomic particles.

### Rutherford’s Nuclear Model (1911):
Ernest Rutherford’s gold foil experiment in 1911 was a landmark in atomic theory. By bombarding thin gold foil with alpha particles, Rutherford observed that most particles passed through, but some deflected sharply. He concluded that atoms have a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus where most of the atom’s mass is concentrated, surrounded by empty space and scattered electrons. This led to the nuclear model, with electrons orbiting a central nucleus.

### Bohr Model (1913):
Niels Bohr refined Rutherford’s model by incorporating quantum theory. Bohr proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus at fixed energy levels and only change orbits by absorbing or emitting specific energy amounts (quantum). This model explained atomic emission spectra and introduced the concept of quantized electron orbits.

### Quantum Mechanical Model (1920s):
Advances in quantum mechanics, particularly through contributions from Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, and others, led to the development of the modern quantum mechanical model. Unlike Bohr’s fixed orbits, this model describes electrons as existing in probabilistic “clouds” or orbitals around the nucleus, defined by complex wave functions. Schrödinger’s wave equation provided a way to calculate the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus.

### Discovery of the Neutron (1932):
James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932, adding a final key component to atomic structure. Neutrons, along with protons, are located in the nucleus and contribute to an atom’s mass without carrying a charge. The existence of neutrons helped explain the previously puzzling atomic masses of elements and clarified the stability of atomic nuclei.

### Modern Atomic Model:
The modern model combines principles from quantum mechanics and nuclear physics. In this model, an atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons occupying regions of space (orbitals) around the nucleus. The behavior of electrons is governed by quantum mechanics, where they exist as probability distributions rather than as discrete particles in fixed paths.

Through these experiments and theoretical advances, scientists determined the atom’s structure as a central nucleus with orbiting electrons, governed by quantum principles. This structure forms the foundation of our understanding of matter and chemistry.

### Protons

The number of proton in the nucleus is called the atomic number. The number of protons in the core (atomic number) gives atoms special properties and becomes a special element. Thus, all atoms containing a proton are hydrogen atoms, and atoms containing two protons are helium atoms. All atoms with the same number of atoms are the same element atoms. 

### Electrons

Electrons are smaller than protons or neutrons and are actually considered almost “massless”. In atoms, electrons move in distant and dispersed clouds around the nucleus. The electrons are limited to a specific energy level within these clouds, which we call a shell of energy level. Different atoms have different electron numbers and different energy layer shells. The maximum number of electrons occupying the given energy level shell is fixed. The energy level 1 can only hold 2 electrons, the energy level 2 can hold 8 electrons, the energy level 3 can hold 18 electrons, and the energy level 4 can hold 32 electrons.

### Neutrons

Because neutrons are electrically neutral, they cannot change the number of atoms of elements. However, neutrons change the mass of atoms, and **the total number of neutrons and protons in atomic nuclei is called mass number**. The number of protons in the nucleus (atomic number) is indicated in the subscripts before the chemical symbol. On the contrary, the total number of protons and neutrons (mass) is indicated in superscripts. Thus, helium has the number of atoms 2 and the number of masses 4 and is written as ${}^{4}_{2}$He. Hydrogen occupies the first position in the periodic table of elements and has a proton and electron and is ${}^{1}_{1}$H.

## Ions

A fully filled energy-level shell is very stable, similar to a well-balanced boat. To achieve this stability, atoms may share or transfer electrons. In its natural state, an atom is electrically neutral because the positive charge of its protons balances the negative charge of its electrons. When an electron is transferred to stabilize energy-level shells, this balance is disrupted. An atom that loses an electron becomes positively charged, while an atom that gains an electron becomes negatively charged. An atom with an excess positive or negative charge due to electron transfer is called an ion. A positively charged ion (from losing electrons) is a cation, and a negatively charged ion (from gaining electrons) is an anion.

The most convenient way to indicate ionic charges is with superscripts. 

- For example, Ca${}^{+2}$ is a cation (calcium) that has given up two electrons, and F${F^{-1}}$ is an anion (fluorine) that has accepted an electron. 

:::{note}
Since ion formation only involves electrons in the energy-level shells and not the protons or neutrons in the nucleus, atomic and mass number symbols are typically not mentioned in describing the ions.

## Isotopes

Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. This means that while isotopes of an element share the same atomic number, they have different mass numbers. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes: 

- carbon-12 (${^{12}_{6}}$C) with six neutrons
- carbon-13 (${^{13}_{6}}$C) with seven neutrons.

Isotopes are important in geology for several reasons:

### Radiometric Dating
Isotopes are crucial in radiometric dating, a method used to determine the age of rocks and minerals. Certain isotopes are unstable and decay over time at a predictable rate, known as a half-life. By measuring the ratio of parent isotopes to daughter products in a sample, geologists can calculate the time elapsed since the rock or mineral formed. Commonly used isotopes for radiometric dating include uranium-238 (which decays to lead-206) and potassium-40 (which decays to argon-40).

### Tracing Geological Processes
Stable isotopes, such as those of oxygen and carbon, are used to trace geological processes and past environmental conditions. For instance, the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in ice cores and marine sediments can provide information about past climate changes and ocean temperatures. Similarly, carbon isotopes can help reconstruct past vegetation and carbon cycle dynamics.

### Understanding Elemental Distribution
Isotopes help in understanding the distribution and movement of elements within the Earth. For example, variations in the isotopic composition of strontium in rocks can reveal information about the sources and processes involved in the formation of igneous and sedimentary rocks.

### Identifying Sources of Contamination
Isotopic analysis can be used to identify sources of contamination in the environment. For example, the isotopic composition of lead can distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources of lead pollution.

In summary, isotopes are invaluable tools in geology for dating rocks, tracing geological and environmental processes, understanding elemental distribution, and identifying contamination sources.
