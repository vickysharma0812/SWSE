# Conglomerate

Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock composed of rounded gravel-sized clasts surrounded by finer sediments like sand, silt, or clay. The clasts and matrix are cemented by materials such as calcium carbonate, iron oxide, or silica. Conglomerates form from gravels deposited by water or glaciers, which become cemented over time. They are found in sedimentary sequences of all ages but are less than 1% of all sedimentary rocks. Fanglomerates are a type of conglomerate formed from debris flows on alluvial fans and contain large gravel accumulations.
