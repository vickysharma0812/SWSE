# Intrusive igneous rocks

Intrusive igneous rocks are formed when the magma cools slowly and crystallizes below the surface of Earth. 
These rocks typically have large, well-formed crystals due to the slow cooling process. 

Common examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, diorite, and gabbro. 

They are often found in mountainous regions and are used in construction due to their durability and aesthetic appeal.

When such rocks are exposed to the Earth's surface we can assume that erosion has removed the surface material originally covering them. 

In what follow we describe the basic types of igeneous intrusions.

Note: As a general rule, in contrast to the active volcanic vent in the figure, these names refer to the fully cooled and usually millions-of-years-old rock formations, which are the result of the underground magmatic activity shown.

:::{note} Phenocrystals
Phenocrystals are large, conspicuous crystals in an intrusive igneous rock that are significantly larger than the grains of the surrounding groundmass or matrix. They form early in the cooling history of the magma and have sufficient time to grow to a larger size before the remaining melt solidifies more rapidly.

Granites often have large feldspathic phenocrysts. This granite, from the Swiss side of the Mont Blanc massif, has large white phenocrysts of plagioclase (that have trapezoid shapes when cut through). 1 euro coin (diameter 2.3 cm) for scale.

## Batholiths

Batholiths are large masses of intrusive igneous rock that have solidified deep within the Earth's crust. They are typically composed of granite or granodiorite and cover an area of at least 100 square kilometers. Batholiths form from multiple intrusions of magma over a long period, which then cool and crystallize slowly. Batholiths are almost always made mostly of felsic or intermediate rock types, such as granite, quartz monzonite, or diorite.

These structures are often exposed at the surface due to erosion and can form the core of mountain ranges such as Half dome in Yosemite National Park.

:::{note}
Batholiths are made up of multiple plutons, which are large bodies of igneous rock. These plutons have different ages, compositions, and textures. They form from magma that moves up from deep within the Earth's crust and solidifies. A batholith is also formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock.

The Antioquia Batholith in Colombia is a group of plutons covering about 7,800 square kilometers. Much of it is weathered into a thick saprolite layer, which can be up to 200 meters deep in some areas. This weathering is due to the humid climate and stable conditions with little erosion. Where the saprolite is eroded, inselbergs like El Peñón de Guatapé are exposed (see [Figure](#guatape-1)). These granitic rock formations resist weathering and erosion because they are less fractured than the surrounding rock.

## Plutons

Plutons are bodies of intrusive igneous rock that crystallize from magma cooling below the surface of the Earth. They vary in size and shape, ranging from small dikes and sills to large batholiths. Plutons are classified based on their size, shape, and relationship to the surrounding rock. 

Common types of plutons include:

- **Dikes**: Tabular bodies that cut across pre-existing rock layers.
- **Sills**: Tabular bodies that are parallel to the rock layers they intrude.
- **Laccoliths**: Dome-shaped bodies that cause the overlying rock layers to arch upwards.
- **Stocks**: Smaller versions of batholiths, covering less than 100 square kilometers.

## Dikes

Dikes are tabular discordant intrusions, taking the form of sheets that cut across existing rock beds. They tend to resist erosion, so that they stand out as natural walls on the landscape.

Dikes can be either magmatic or sedimentary in origin. 

**Magmatic dikes** form when magma flows into a crack then solidifies as a sheet intrusion, either cutting across layers of rock or through a contiguous mass of rock.

Makhtesh Ramon (Ramon crater), located in Israel’s Negev desert, is a 40 km long crater that varies between 2 and 10 km wide, and up to 500 meters deep. Unlike typical impact or volcanic craters, a makhtesh is created by erosion and may be unique to the Negev/Sinai region. Makhtesh Ramon is the largest of the five in the Negev.

:::{note}
The thickness of a dike is much smaller than its other two dimensions,[9] and the opposite walls are roughly parallel, so that a dike is more or less constant in thickness.

Clastic dikes are formed when sediment fills a pre-existing crack.

## Sill

In geology, a sill is a tabular sheet intrusion that has intruded between older layers of sedimentary rock, beds of volcanic lava or tuff, or along the direction of foliation in metamorphic rock.

## Minerals of intrusive rocks

- Most batholiths are formed of granitic rocks, but dikes and solls may be basaltic.
