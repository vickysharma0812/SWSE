# Rocks and soils

A rock is a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Rocks are categorized by the minerals included, their chemical composition, and the way in which they are formed. The three main types of rocks are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.

- **Igneous rocks** are formed from solidified magma or lava.
- **Sedimentary rocks** are formed from the accumulation of sediments.
- **Metamorphic rocks** are formed from existing rocks that are changed by heat, pressure, or chemical processes.

Rocks are an integral part of the Earth's crust and are used in various applications, from construction to decorative arts.

Minerals are the most common building blocks of rocks; however, it is possible for a rock to not be made of minerals. For example, coal is a rock that is entirely composed of organic matter.

## Rock cycle

The rock cycle produces following three types of rocks; 

**1. Igeneous rock**: Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava (molten rocks). They can be intrusive (formed beneath the Earth's surface) or extrusive (formed at the surface). Examples include granite (intrusive) and basalt (extrusive). 

:::{note}
Magma is molten rocks which is one of the important liquid material on earth. Magma forms deep inside the earth. It reaches the surface of earth while passing through a vent or crack. The magma flowing over the surface of earth is called lava, and the vent through which it emerges is called a volcano.

**2. Sedimentary rocks:**  

Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compaction of mineral and organic particles over time. These particles, or sediments, are often transported by water, wind, or ice and deposited in layers. Sedimentary rocks are also formed due to chemical precipitation of material carried in solution in sea, lake, or river water. Over long periods, the layers are compacted and cemented together to form solid rock. Common examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale.

Sedimentary rocks often contain fossils, which are the preserved remains of ancient organisms. These fossils provide valuable information about the Earth's history and past environments.

**3. Metamorphic rock**

Metamorphic rocks are formed from existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks) that undergo a transformation due to high heat, pressure, or chemically active fluids. This process, called metamorphism, alters the mineral composition and structure of the original rock without melting it. Metamorphic rocks can be foliated (having a layered or banded appearance) or non-foliated (lacking distinct layers).

Examples of metamorphic rocks include:

- **Slate**: Formed from shale, it has fine grains and splits into thin sheets.
- **Schist**: Characterized by its foliated texture and often contains visible mineral grains.
- **Marble**: Formed from limestone, it is non-foliated and often used in sculpture and architecture.
- **Gneiss**: Exhibits a banded or layered appearance and is formed from high-grade metamorphism of igneous or sedimentary rocks.

Metamorphic rocks provide insights into the conditions deep within the Earth's crust and the processes that shape our planet over geological time.

### Definition

:::{attention} Definition of Rock Cycle

The rock cycle is a continuous process by which rocks are created, transformed, and recycled over geological time. It describes the transitions between the three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The cycle outlines how each rock type can be converted into another through various geological processes such as melting, cooling, erosion, sedimentation, and metamorphism.

We can also think rock cycle as a process through which the subsurface processes in earth are linked to the surface processes. The subsurface processes are driven by Earth's internal heat, which melts or changes rocks in the tectonic cycle.

### Stages of the Rock Cycle

**Formation of Igneous Rocks: Magma cools and solidifies to form igneous rocks**

When rocks are pushed deep under the Earth's surface, they may melt into magma. If the magma cools and solidifies within the Earth, it forms intrusive igneous rocks like granite, which have a coarse-grained texture due to slow cooling. If the magma reaches the Earth's surface and cools rapidly, it forms extrusive igneous rocks like basalt, which are fine-grained. Sometimes, rapid cooling produces natural glass, such as obsidian. Any rock type (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) can melt into magma and cool into igneous rocks.

**Weathering and Erosion Igneous rocks are broken down into sediments by weathering and erosion**

Rocks exposed to the atmosphere undergo weathering and erosion, breaking them into smaller fragments and dissolving materials.

**Formation of Sedimentary Rocks Sediments are compacted and cemented to form sedimentary rocks**

These fragments accumulate and are buried by more material. When these fragments fuse together, they form sedimentary rocks. 

Sedimentary rocks can be:
- **Clastic**: Formed from fragments of other rocks.
- **Biogenic**: Formed from the accumulation of organic material, like fossils.
- **Precipitate**: Formed from minerals precipitated from a solution.

Clastic rocks come from broken fragments of any rock type, while biogenic and precipitate rocks form from minerals deposited from dissolved chemicals. 

**Metamorphism: Sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat and pressure to form metamorphic rocks**

Rocks subjected to high temperatures and pressures can undergo physical or chemical changes to become metamorphic rocks. Regional metamorphism affects large rock masses over extensive areas, often linked to mountain-building events within orogenic belts, and typically results in rocks with distinct bands of different minerals and colors, known as foliation. Another type, contact metamorphism, occurs when a rock body comes into contact with an igneous intrusion, causing the surrounding rock to heat up and re-crystallize due to the extreme heat and the addition of chemicals from the magma (metasomatism). Any existing rock type can be transformed through metamorphism.

**Melting: Metamorphic rocks melt to form magma, completing the cycle**

This cycle is driven by the Earth's internal heat and external forces such as weathering and erosion, ensuring that rocks are constantly being formed, altered, and recycled.
