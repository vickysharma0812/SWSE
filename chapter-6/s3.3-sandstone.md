# Sandstone

Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized mineral particles or rock fragments. It is typically formed in environments such as beaches, deserts, and riverbeds where sand is deposited by water or wind. 

Sandstone is known for its durability and is often used as a building material. The color of sandstone can vary depending on the minerals it contains, ranging from white to red, yellow, and brown.

Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar, because they are the most resistant minerals to the weathering processes at the Earth's surface.

Rock formations composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities, making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs.[2][3]

Sandstone Erosion Pattern

Sandstones are formed from silicate sand grains which are produced via physical and chemical weathering of bedrocks. These sand grains are transported by water or air, and deposited in a basin. As sediments continue to accumulate in the depositional environment, older sand is buried by younger sediments, and it undergoes diagenesis. This mostly consists of compaction and lithification of the sand.
