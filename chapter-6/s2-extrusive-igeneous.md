# Extrusive Igneous Rocks

Extrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that erupts onto the Earth's surface, where it cools and solidifies quickly. This rapid cooling results in fine-grained textures, as the crystals do not have much time to grow. These rocks are typically found in volcanic regions and are often associated with lava flows, volcanic ash, and pyroclastic deposits. Their composition can vary widely, but they generally have a higher silica content compared to intrusive igneous rocks.

> Extrusive rocks are igneous rocks which forms at the surface of earth by crystallization of lava or molten magma. They can also form from pyroclastic debris, composed of fragmented magma that has rapidly crystallized while coming out of a volcano.

Common types of extrusive igneous rocks include 

- Basalt
- Andesite
- Rhyolite
