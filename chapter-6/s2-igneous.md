# Igneous rocks

Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava (molten rocks). They can be intrusive (formed beneath the Earth's surface) or extrusive (formed at the surface). Examples include granite (intrusive) and basalt (extrusive). 

:::{note} Magma
Magma is molten rocks which is one of the important liquid material on earth. Magma forms deep inside the earth. It reaches the surface of earth while passing through a vent or crack. The magma flowing over the surface of earth is called lava, and the vent through which it emerges is called a volcano. Magma is an earth material which contains a mixture of melted and solid materials.

Magma is often generated in the upper asthenosphere or the lithosphere. 

## Why magma rises

Magma rises towards the Earth's surface due to several factors:

1. **Buoyancy**: Magma is less dense than the surrounding solid rock, causing it to rise through the Earth's crust. This is similar to how oil floats on water.

2. **Pressure**: The immense pressure from the overlying rock layers forces the magma upwards. As magma accumulates, it creates pressure that pushes it through cracks and fissures in the Earth's crust.

3. **Gas Content**: Magma contains dissolved gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. As the magma rises and pressure decreases, these gases expand, reducing the density of the magma and helping it to ascend.

4. **Tectonic Activity**: Movements of the Earth's tectonic plates can create pathways for magma to rise. For example, at divergent boundaries, plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and form new crust. At convergent boundaries, one plate is forced under another, melting and generating magma that can rise to the surface.

The process of magma rising is crucial for the formation of igneous rocks and contributes to volcanic activity, which plays a significant role in shaping the Earth's landscape.

:::{note}
From the above figure we can see that the minerals in rhyolite and granite are same. Similarly, dacite and granodiorite, andesite and diorite, and basalt and gabbro are same. It is the size of the crystals formed by cooling which differentiates extrusive rocks from intrusive rocks.
