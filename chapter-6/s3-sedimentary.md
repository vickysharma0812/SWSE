# Sedimentary rocks

Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation and cementation of particles at Earth's surface. These particles, called sediment, come from weathered rocks, volcanic lava, or biological materials. Sediment is transported by water, wind, ice, or gravity. Sedimentation also occurs when minerals precipitate from water.

Sedimentary rocks cover 73% of the Earth's land surface but make up only 8% of the crust's volume. They form a thin layer over igneous and metamorphic rocks.

Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata, forming a structure called bedding. Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in large structures called sedimentary basins.

The analysis of sedimentary rock layers is crucial for understanding Earth's history, including ancient geography, climate, and life forms. Sedimentology, the scientific field dedicated to studying sedimentary rocks' characteristics and origins, bridges geology and physical geography. It also intersects with other Earth science disciplines like soil science, geomorphology, geochemistry, and structural geology.

Sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into four groups based on the processes responsible for their formation: clastic sedimentary rocks, biochemical (biogenic) sedimentary rocks, chemical sedimentary rocks, and a fourth category for "other" sedimentary rocks formed by impacts, volcanism, and other minor processes. 

## Types of Sedimentary Rocks

- Clastic Sedimentary Rocks
- Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks
- Chemical Sedimentary Rocks
- Other Sedimentary Rocks

## Clastic Sedimentary Rocks
Clastic sedimentary rocks are composed of fragments, or clasts, of pre-existing minerals and rock. These fragments are transported by water, wind, ice, or biological activity and are deposited when the transport medium loses energy. 

Common examples include sandstone, shale, and conglomerate.

Clastic sedimentary rocks are classified based on their particle size as shale, siltstone, sandstone, or conglomerate.

Usually the Udden-Wentworth grain size scale is employed to divide unconsolidated sediment into three fractions

- gravel (greater than 2 mm diameter)
- sand (between 1/16  and 2 mm diameter)
- mud (smaller than 1/16 mm diameter): the mud is further divided into silt and clay
    - silt (1/16 to 1/256 mm diameter)
    - clay (smaller than 1/256 mm diameter)

### Shale

Shale is a fine-grained clastic sedimentary rock composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. Shale is characterized by its fissility, which means it has a tendency to split into thin layers along well-defined planes. This property is due to the alignment of clay mineral flakes within the rock.

### Siltstone

Siltstone or mudstone are compacted or cemented silt and clay lacking fine lamination.

Siltstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of silt-sized particles, which are finer than sand but coarser than clay. It typically forms in environments where water, wind, or ice deposits fine sediment, such as river deltas, floodplains, and offshore marine areas.

Siltstones and sandstones are different from each other. Siltstones contain smaller pores and a higher clay fraction. Although often mistaken for a shale, siltstone lacks the laminations and fissility along horizontal lines which are typical of shale.

### Sandstone

Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized mineral particles or rock fragments. It is typically formed in environments such as beaches, deserts, and riverbeds where sand is deposited by water or wind. Sandstone is known for its durability and is often used as a building material. The color of sandstone can vary depending on the minerals it contains, ranging from white to red, yellow, and brown.

Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar, because they are the most resistant minerals to the weathering processes at the Earth's surface.

### Conglomerate

Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock composed of rounded gravel-sized clasts surrounded by finer sediments like sand, silt, or clay. The clasts and matrix are cemented by materials such as calcium carbonate, iron oxide, or silica. Conglomerates form from gravels deposited by water or glaciers, which become cemented over time. They are found in sedimentary sequences of all ages but are less than 1% of all sedimentary rocks. Fanglomerates are a type of conglomerate formed from debris flows on alluvial fans and contain large gravel accumulations.

Ferruginous quartz-pebble conglomerate from the Pennsylvanian of Ohio, USA. This rock is from an outcrop in southern Ohio exposing the lowermost Pottsville Group, a Pennsylvanian-aged succession containing shales, siltstones, sandstones, coals, and limestones. The basal Pottsville is a quartz-pebble conglomerate with a quartzose sandstone unit above it. The conglomerate includes various clasts such as shale, sandstone, ironstone, quartz sandstone, quartzite, and silicified limestone. A unique feature is the presence of ferruginous quartz-pebble conglomerate clasts. The outcrop is located along Rt. 35 near Jackson, Ohio.

### Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks
Biochemical sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation of biological material, such as shells or plant debris. These rocks often contain fossils and are typically formed in marine environments. Limestone, formed from the calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms, and coal, formed from plant material, are examples of biochemical sedimentary rocks.

Coal, formed from plants that have removed carbon from the atmosphere and combined it with other elements to build their tissue.

### Chemical Sedimentary Rocks
Chemical sedimentary rocks form when minerals precipitate from a solution, typically water. This process can occur in bodies of water such as lakes, seas, or hot springs. Common examples include rock salt, formed from the evaporation of seawater, and gypsum.

### Other Sedimentary Rocks
This category includes sedimentary rocks formed by less common processes such as volcanic activity, impacts, and other minor processes. Examples include tuff, formed from volcanic ash, and breccia, formed from angular fragments of rock cemented together.

## Diagenesis

Diagenesis refers to the physical, chemical, and biological changes that occur in sediment after it is deposited and during and after its lithification, excluding surface weathering. These processes occur at relatively low temperatures and pressures and result in the transformation of sediment into sedimentary rock.

### Stages of Diagenesis

1. **Compaction**: As layers of sediment accumulate, the weight of the overlying material compresses the deeper sediments, reducing pore space and expelling pore water.
2. **Cementation**: Minerals precipitate from groundwater moving through the pore spaces between sediment grains, binding them together to form solid rock. Common cementing agents include silica, calcite, and iron oxides.
3. **Recrystallization**: Minerals within the sediment may dissolve and reprecipitate, changing the mineral composition and texture of the rock. This process can enhance the strength and durability of the rock.
4. **Chemical Alteration**: Chemical reactions between minerals and pore water can alter the mineralogy of the sediment. For example, feldspar can alter to clay minerals through hydrolysis.
