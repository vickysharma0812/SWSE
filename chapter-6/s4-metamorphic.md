# Metamorphic rocks

The igneous and metamorphic rocks together account for more than 90% of all rocks in Earth's crust. 

Metamorphic rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks) that have been transformed by high heat, pressure, or chemically active fluids. This process, called metamorphism, alters the mineral composition and structure of the original rock without melting it.

There are two main types of metamorphism: contact metamorphism and regional metamorphism. Contact metamorphism occurs when rocks are heated by nearby magma or lava, while regional metamorphism happens over large areas due to tectonic forces that generate high pressure and temperature.

Common examples of metamorphic rocks include slate, which originates from shale, and marble, which forms from limestone. These rocks often exhibit foliation, a layered or banded appearance resulting from the reorientation of minerals under directional pressure.

## Generalized environment of metamorphism

The generalized geological conditions (pressure-temperature conditions) that is suitable for metamorphism are given in [Figure](#meta-1). 

As with igneous processes, metamorphic rocks form at different zones of pressure (depth) and temperature as shown on the pressure-temperature (P-T) diagram. The term facies is an objective description of a rock. In metamorphic rocks, facies are groups of minerals called mineral assemblages. The names of metamorphic facies on the pressure-temperature diagram reflect minerals and mineral assemblages that are stable at these pressures and temperatures and provide information about the metamorphic processes that have affected the rocks. This is useful when interpreting the history of metamorphic rock.
Metamorphic facies are controlled by temperature and pressure.

- Low temp and pressure facies are zeolite facies. 
- Low pressure but higher temp are greenschist then hornfels facies. 
- Higher pressures create amphibolite and granulite facies. 
- High pressure and temperature facies are eclogite facies.

### High pressure and low temperature metamorphism

These conditions are characteristics of subduction zones.

### High pressure and high temperature metamorphism

These are the characteristics of regional metamorphism that might be produced during continental collision. 

- In this environment, rock metamorphism changes low-grade sedimentary rocks to high-grade metamorphic rocks with increasing temperature and pressure. 
- The rocks progressively change from sedimentary rock to low-grade metamorphic rock known as slate, to an intermediate-grade metamorphic rock known as schist, and finally to a high-grade metamorphic rock known as gneiss. 
- The original shale, a sedimentary rock, is thus transformed to slate, and then schist, and then gneiss, through progressive regional metamorphism as a result of increasing temperature and pressure.

### High-temperature, low-pressure metamorphism

These condition are suitable for contact metamorphism. 

When magma intrudes the upper crust, it heats nearby surrounding rocks, but, because it is close to the surface, the pressure is relatively low. This increased temperature causes the formation of particular types of metamorphic minerals and rocks in the contact zone.
