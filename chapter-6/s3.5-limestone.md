# Limestone

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCOâ‚ƒ) in the form of the mineral calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of CaCO3. 

It often contains skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, foraminifera, and mollusks. 

Limestone is typically formed in clear, warm, shallow marine waters through the accumulation of biological debris or by the precipitation of calcium carbonate from water.

Limestone has numerous uses, including as a building material, an essential component of concrete (Portland cement), and as aggregate for the base of roads. It is also used in the production of lime (calcium oxide), which is an important industrial chemical.

Limestone often contains fossils which provide scientists with information on ancient environments and on the evolution of life.

The rock is known for its durability and versatility, making it a popular choice in architecture and construction. Notable structures made from limestone include the Great Pyramid of Giza and many medieval churches and castles in Europe.

In addition to its practical applications, limestone landscapes, known as karst, are characterized by features such as caves, sinkholes, and underground rivers, which are formed by the dissolution of limestone over time.
