# Siltstone

Siltstone or mudstone are compacted or cemented silt and clay lacking fine lamination.

Siltstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of silt-sized particles, which are finer than sand but coarser than clay. It typically forms in environments where water, wind, or ice deposits fine sediment, such as river deltas, floodplains, and offshore marine areas.

:::{note}
Siltstones and sandstones are different from each other. Siltstones contain smaller pores and a higher clay fraction. Although often mistaken for a shale, siltstone lacks the laminations and fissility along horizontal lines which are typical of shale.
