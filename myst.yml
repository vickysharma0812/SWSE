  description: Ecosystem science is a vast subject that comprises the study of biotic and abiotic components in an ecosystem and the interactions among them. This course provides an introduction to the science of two major physical components of ecosystems; water and soil. Understanding the earth's structure, the movement and distribution of water and the mechanics of soils can help answer issues related to sustenance of life like the availability of fresh water and food sources, natural and anthropogenic disturbances leading to geo-disasters etc. Study of such interactions between the physical and living environment will help develop tools for the assessment, management and mitigation of environmental impacts. Based on a scientific perspective, the course will also provide a foundation for the quantification of hydrological and geotechnical data. The contents of this course will aid students interested in a career in diverse fields like environmental sustainability, climate modeling, geology, hydrology, ecology, agriculture, forestry and many more.
